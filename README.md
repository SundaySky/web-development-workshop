## Getting started with Github Pages
0. If you don't have on already, open a user in [Github](https://github.com).
1. Create a new repository for the workshop. If you're new to Git or Github, download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Feel free to ask for help or consult [Github Desktop's help](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop).
2. Enable GitHub Pages by navigating to the repository's settings tab and scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section. Set Source to "master branch".
3. That's it! pages should be avalible in a few moments in your own page (eg. https://{username}.github.io/{repository-name}/). The pages will update every time you'll push to master.

Take a look at [Github Pages FAQ](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages) for more info.
